# Egg Timer

It's an app with timer that gives us notifications when our eggs are ready. It has 3 type of degrees which allows us to choose what kind of eggs we want to cook. In this app i'm implemeting base skills of Swift like conditional statements, dictionaries, some functions and also i'm using Swift Timer API.
